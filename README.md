### What I learned

I learned how to maintain fluid typography in the UI when designing the intro section with dropdown navigation, ensuring that the text scales gracefully across different screen sizes, and providing a seamless user experience on a wide range of devices.


### Continued development

I want to explore more intuitive layouts for different sections of the UI, focusing on creating designs that not only look visually appealing but also enhance user interaction and navigation, ultimately improving the overall usability and user experience of the interface
